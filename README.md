### IDEA project setup

1. File -> Import project... -> .../beholder/build.gradle

2. Run 'assemble' gradle task (from IDEA or just `./gradlew`)
   to compile everything and place certain things where IDEA can see them

3. Mark file `frontend/src/main/kotlin/kotlin-js-library/core/javalang.kt` as plain text
   so it won't confuse IDEA
