###
## SETTINGS
#

# When Beholder creates a datetime (e.g. when a new message is received), it uses system timezone.
# You can override this by setting `create_dates_in_timezone` to a desired timezone.
# See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html#of-java.lang.String- for details.
# Example timezones: `UTC`, `Europe/Moscow`.
# When a date is received in a message (not created), Beholder will try to keep its timezone intact.

#create_dates_in_timezone UTC;

# Beholder periodically initiates JVM garbage collection in order to keep memory footprint as low as possible.
# Because messages are processed using lots of short-lived objects, by default we initiate GC every 5 seconds.
# This can be changed using `extra_gc_interval_seconds` config option. If you don't want this behaviour,
# extra GC can be disabled by setting `extra_gc_interval_seconds` to 0.

#extra_gc_interval_seconds 5;

# When messages cannot be processed quick enough, they are stored in queues.
# When the config is being reloaded, incoming messages are stored in from-queues.
# When a destination (e.g. a TCP server) is unavailable, outgoing payloads are stored in to-queues.
#
# A queue will group messages into chunks. When there are a lot of chunks in a queue, they get stored in a buffer.
# Currently there is only one buffer for all this data: the default buffer. Default buffer size can be set using
# `buffer_memory_bytes` option. You can specify a number of bytes or use a suffix: `k`, `m`, `g`.
#
# `buffer_memory_bytes` is NOT the total memory limit of Beholder. In addition to unbuffered messages in queues,
# there are lots of things on JVM that eat bytes. Watch your metrics!

#buffer_memory_bytes 128m;
#queue_chunk_messages 500;

# When a queue chunk is buffered, it is compressed. You can turn off compression with `buffer_compression off`.

#buffer_compression lz4-fast; # one of: lz4-fast, off
