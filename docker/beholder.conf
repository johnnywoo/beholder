###
## SETTINGS
#

# Beholder periodically initiates JVM garbage collection in order to keep memory footprint as low as possible.
# Because messages are processed using lots of short-lived objects, by default we initiate GC every 5 seconds.
# This can be changed using `extra_gc_interval_seconds` config option. If you don't want this behaviour,
# extra GC can be disabled by setting `extra_gc_interval_seconds` to 0.

#extra_gc_interval_seconds 5;

# Internal buffer options, docs are to be written.

#queue_chunk_messages 500;
